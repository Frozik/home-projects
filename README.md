This page contains my resume, which you can view and download in PDF format.

## Pendulum
The goal of the application is to find the structure of the neural network and its weights using a genetic algorithm to
balance the pendulum around the zero mark.

### Fitness Playground
This is an area for simulating the physical world for neural networks. The best candidates will be selected using a
genetic algorithm, which will involve mutation or crossover. This will become available when a new generation is
uploaded or created. By default, the simulation is paused. You can resume it by clicking on the pause icon or by
selecting the tab (by clicking anywhere on the tab) and pressing the space. Simulation speed depends on your CPU and
will be adjusted automatically (UI will not freeze).

### Generations
This window is used to load automatically saved generations or to create a new generation. After making a selection in
this window, a table will be displayed showing the generation number and all the robots from that generation. You can
select any robot and run it in a testing environment to observe how it behaves when external forces are applied.

### Test Playground
This area is designated for testing robots. By selecting a specific robot, you can apply force (introducing instability)
by clicking on the testing area. The closer the mouse is to the pendulum's weight, the stronger the effect will be; the
longer the mouse button is held down, the greater the force applied. You can deselect the chosen robot by clicking on it
in the upper left corner, allowing the user to try to balance the pendulum manually. User controls include the left and
right arrow keys for moving the carriage and the Shift key for boosting.

### Neural Network
This area displays the structure of the neural network, including the weights and biases of the neurons, as well as the
layers and the number of neurons in each layer. To view the weights and biases of a neuron, hover the mouse over the
neuron of interest.

## Sudoku
Yet another implementation of the Sudoku game, but with the controls that I like the most

## Sun
Not all GPU correctly support gl_InstanceID & gl_VertexID. This is small test for this shader feature.

## Charts
Example of plotting charts on the GPU
* Varying line thickness at the start and end of segments
* Gradient coloring
* Rounded segment endings


## [Missing] Financial controls: Rate with PIPs, Calendar with Tenors (With nanoseconds and timezone support)
## [Missing] Face detection from camera + effects
